### General info
I began this project on the 5th of May 2021. It is Assignment 2 for the Enterprise Web Development module, of the H.Dip. in Science in Computer Science in WIT.
It consists of a desktop app that is used for uploading 'Points of Interest', which for my own project, will consist of pubs. Essentially, a repository for pubs that users can browse, and to which they can add (and edit/update existing entries).
Note: to use this app, the environmental variables will have to be configured. This can be done using the '.env-sample' as a template.
