### General info
I carried out this project in May 2021. It is Assignment 2 for the Enterprise Web Development module, of the H.Dip. in Science in Computer Science in WIT.
It consists of a desktop app that is used for uploading 'Points of Interest', or, as per my own design: 'Pubs of Interest'. Essentially, a repository for pubs that the user can find some very basic information on, and can upload their own pubs of interest, and edit/update existing entries on the system.
It is a continuation of Assignment 1 (Áiteanna Spéisiúla), which was a node application. This a Svelte front end application that draws from the APIs of Áiteanna Spéisiúla.
Note: to use this app, the environmental variables will have to be configured. This can be done using the '.env-sample' as a template.

* JavaScript
* handlebars
